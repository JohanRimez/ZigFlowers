ZigFlowers
Johan Rimez - 2024

This is an open source project featuring:
* ZIG programming language (ziglang.org)
* SDL2 - Simple DirectMedia Layer (www.libsdl.org)

This program is intended to demonstrate graphics programming for a simple but fully working coding example using ZIG & SDL.

The original idea for the program came from this coding tutorial:

Patt Vira - "Hypnotic Flowers"

REMARK:

I used the "Software Renderer" to interact with the Surfaces to easily implement the XOR - blending. I know it's a strech on CPU usage,
but I simply can't find any decent equivalent with the hardware accelerated renderer (acting on Textures). If anybody has a found a better alternative,
please notify!

Kind regards
Johan*
